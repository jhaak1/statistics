This repository includes three files:
1. anova.pdf - shows how to perform a one-way ANOVA in R and then make a bar graph using ggplot2.
2. hclust.pdf - my approach for performing hierarchical clustering on a breast cancer dataset.
3. pca.pdf - my approach for performing principal component analysis (PCA) on a dataset of student dropouts and academic success.  In this analysis, I used Z-scores to scale the data, although center log-ratios can sometimes do a better job of separating the data.
